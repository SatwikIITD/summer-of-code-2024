# Week 1: Fraud Detection System

## 1. Introduction
This week, we built a fraud detection system for our Point of Sale (PoS) application using Google Colab for development. The goal was to identify potentially fraudulent transactions using various machine learning techniques.

## 2. Workflow Overview
1. **Set Up Google Colab with GPU Support**
   - Accessed Google Colab and created a new notebook with GPU support.

2. **Find and Load a Dataset**
   - Searched for a fraud detection dataset on Kaggle and loaded it using pandas for initial exploration.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numerical features using pandas and scikit-learn.

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Implemented feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance, considering both manual and automated methods.

5. **Address Class Imbalance**
   - Applied techniques like SMOTE and random under-sampling to balance the dataset, crucial for training unbiased fraud detection models.

6. **Implement Classification Algorithms**
   - Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM to determine the best performing model.

7. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics such as precision-recall curve and ROC AUC score.

8. **Model Interpretability**
   - Explored methods to interpret model decisions and understand feature importance for better fraud detection insights.

9. **Create a Real-time Fraud Detection API**
   - Explored creating a real-time fraud detection API as an optional extension, integrating the trained model for live transaction monitoring.
